## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24+
- pnpm 9+
- PostgreSQL database

### Environment Variables

| Variable       | Description                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------|
| `DATABASE_URL`  | PostgreSQL connection string  |
| `SESSION_SECRET`| Session signing secret        |
| `PORT`          | Service port (set by Replit)  |

### Run Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Push database schema
pnpm --filter @workspace/db run push

# Start the API server (port 5000)
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run dev

# Start the frontend (separate terminal)
pnpm --filter @workspace/nulltrace run dev
```

### Codegen (after OpenAPI spec changes)

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-spec run codegen
```

### Typecheck

```bash
pnpm run typecheck
```

## Architecture Decisions

- **Contract-first API** — The OpenAPI spec in `lib/api-spec` is the single source of truth. All React Query hooks and Zod validation schemas are generated from it via Orval, keeping client and server perfectly in sync.
- **Drizzle ORM** — Chosen over Prisma for its lightweight footprint, TypeScript-native query builder, and direct SQL control where needed.
- **Wouter routing** — Minimal client-side router (~2kb) over React Router for a leaner bundle.
- **Tailwind v4** — Dark mode applied via `document.documentElement.classList.add("dark")` in JS rather than `@apply dark`, since `dark` is a variant not a utility class in v4.
- **Glassmorphism UI** — All cards use `glass-card` with backdrop blur and semi-transparent borders to reinforce the dark, futuristic war room aesthetic.

## Design System

- **Color palette** — Neon blue (`#3b82f6`) and purple (`#8b5cf6`) accents on a deep dark background
- **Typography** — Inter font, tight tracking for headings, monospace for code/log output
- **Glow effects** — `neon-text-blue`, `neon-border-blue`, `neon-border-purple` utility classes
- **Blink animation** — `animate-blink` for live status indicators
- **Glass cards** — `glass-card` class with `backdrop-blur-md` and `bg-white/5` layering

---

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2. Run `pnpm run typecheck` before committing
3. Follow the contract-first approach — update the OpenAPI spec before adding new routes, then run codegen
4. Keep route handlers thin — push business logic into `lib/` helpers
